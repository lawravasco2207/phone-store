   - Test payment flows with real test accounts
   - Ensure responsive design works on all target devices

4. **Production Optimizations**
   - Enable server-side rendering (if needed)
   - Configure proper CDN caching headers
   - Set up database connection pooling
   - Configure proper logging and monitoring

5. **Security Checklist**
   - Run security scans for vulnerabilities
   - Ensure CORS is properly configured
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Set secure cookie settings (httpOnly, sameSite, secure)

## ÔøΩ Product Ingestion System

## ÔøΩüìù Additional Notes

The application is now structured according to best practices for production deployment, with a clear separation of concerns and modular components. The codebase is now more maintainable, secure, and ready for scaling.

All mock data has been removed, and the application is now set up to connect to real backend services. The improved error handling ensures a better user experience even when issues occur.

The chatbot component has been significantly enhanced with modern UI/UX features, making it more engaging and usable for customers.

The new product ingestion system provides a scalable solution for managing product data, from manual entry to fully automated API integrations, enabling the business to grow without changing systems.
